plane - stands for perl with -lane switches.

 * Replaces awk - reads a file from standard input into @F variable.
   and allows easy filtering including regexp group matching.
 * Run without params to show numbers of fields in standard input.
 * You can access fields from end and grep using: 

     plane 'print @F[-1] if @F[0] =~ /^192.168.0.1/'

 * You can print multiple fields:

     plane 'print join("\t",@F[0..2,-1])'
